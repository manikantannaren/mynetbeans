#About mynetbeans

A repository of my experiments with NetBeans. Some of these experiments might result in NetBeans plugins.

I have been using NetBeans since early on first via Forte for Java. I loved that very much compared to IBM Visual Age and Symantec Visual Cafe. Yes! Since that young. Later when Sun decided to wreck Forte For Java, I moved full time to NetBeans (was verion 5 I think).

Over the years, I resisted popular opinion and organizational pressures to move away from NetBeans so much so that I am always in the NetBeans users minority of 1. Over so many years some of the things that helped me retain my love for the NetBeans IDE are

    Simplicity - install and ready to use.
    Project type coverage - Any type of project was easy to start off - be it a library or a web application or a Swing UI.
    Evolution of NetBeans did not mean a balky eco-system.
    I was not into Maven or Gradle until a couple of years ago and the transition from good ol' ant build system was smooth.
    Newer Java ecosystem paradigms like JPA, REST/Jersey/Wicket was adapted to seamlessly, Lambda, Generics

Coming to Today, some of my favorite NetBeans features are

    The Terminal window. It has it's hiccups but none which are show stoppers. I don't have to leave my beloved even for a second to do something in a terminal. I can now do it all within the IDE
    HTML5 support - The Google connector is a boon. The bi-directional code changes trim down my effort in devloping HTML5 pages. I have quite a few NB converts because of this one feature.
    Coding REST API - Now this is one feature I use fairly regularly and the speed with which my REST API is coded, tested and improved is helping me migrate people to NetBeans
    Module development - The first plugin I wrote, the now defunct export as archive was developed in two days by just following the project and New file wizards and Geertjan's blog
    NetCat program - The real giveback from me to NetBeans was to enroll in the NetCat program.
        I learnt a few things about the IDE,
        Learnt some new Java Cool features (Lambda for example)
        Got to know some people with infectious enthusiasm
